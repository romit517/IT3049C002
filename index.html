        <h2>Experiences...</h2>
        <p>
            My experience in the United States was really interesting. It was my first time here. I was really excited for this journey
            of travelling 8,431 miles from my home to study here. At first when I came here, I was a bit worried as I didn't know anyone here,
            but soon as the time passed by, I started meeting new people and getting used to the life here. I'm extremely grateful that I got
            this amazing opportunity to study in the States..
